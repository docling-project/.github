**<a href="https://github.com/docling-project/docling">Docling</a>** is our main open-source package. It is a powerful library which simplifies document processing, parsing diverse formats — including advanced PDF understanding — and providing seamless integrations with the gen AI ecosystem.

We support an amazing community which helps us driving forward the adoption of Docling.
Give it a try and join the community!
